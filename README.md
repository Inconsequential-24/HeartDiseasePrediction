# HeartDiseasePrediction
Predicting Heart Disease Probability Using the Framingham Heart Study Dataset
The Framingham Heart Study Dataset Was Used to Train the ML model.
Various algorithms were used to make the ML Model and their F1 scores were calculated.
Based on the results of F1 Score the Best Algorithm was used to make a ML Model which would take the input from the user and predict the probability of them having a heart disease.
The code for predicting the probability of having a heart disease is in the file- 'fhsdtpred.py'.

Happy Learining!
